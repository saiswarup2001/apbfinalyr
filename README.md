Designing of CSR using Verilog - 1. Implementation of Address Decoder.
                                 2. Each output of the Address Decoder behaves as the enable pin for the D-FF.
                                 3. Designing of a RW Register[Read Write], using D-FF.
                                 4. Design one Multiplexer where the selection pins are shorted with address pin of Address Decoder. And Output of the RW Reg is connected to the input pins of the multiplexer.
                                 5. Design of a .csv file with i_addr, i_reg, i_data. And validate it using python.
                                 6. synthesis the rtl code using python.
